### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm soemone, you: a random stranger on the internet, do not have the required elevations to know my real name. So, stick with soemone, or you can also call me "a user" and any variations of the two.

### About me ig
<span style="whitespace: pre">
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on      : my supa cool, bare-bones, and non-working / buggy unnamed-language!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning        : pretty sure it's mastering Rust
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on : same as below I guess 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with     : if you wanna help with my code, cool, if you wanna look cool. You decide. Buuuuut I really want your help to come up with a meaningful & catchy name for my new language (that probably won't be too amazing) 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about                  : nothing would be preferable
- ðŸ“« How to reach me               : umm... you can use user.some1@outlook.com (though I rarely look).
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns                      : he/him, and anything else you call a male.
- âš¡ Fun fact                      : nothing random strangers on the internet would need to know.

I have used the default github thing because I dunno what to put here, really.
